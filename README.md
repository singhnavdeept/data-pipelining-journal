# 🧠 Knowledge Vault: BTech CSE Notes Repository

Welcome to my personal notes repository — a living, evolving collection of hand-crafted notes, learnings, and breakdowns from my journey as a BTech CSE student and aspiring Data Engineer.

This is not just a folder of files. It’s a **curated knowledge base** — updated regularly as I go deeper into concepts, debug real problems, and build solutions that matter.
