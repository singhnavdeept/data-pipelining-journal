Alright, listen up. Four months to go from where you are to job-ready in data pipelining? That's ambitious, but doable if you're serious and put in the work. No slacking, no excuses. 15-20 hours a week means *focused* hours. We're building muscle memory and real understanding, not just ticking boxes.

You've got a decent Python/Pandas base, which is great. Your SQL needs work – it's the bedrock. We'll fix that. Forget fancy titles for now; focus on the *skills* that get you hired.

Here’s the plan. It’s packed, progressive, and practical. Stick to it, do the work, and you'll be in a strong position. I'm picking **AWS** as the cloud platform here because it's widely used, but the concepts transfer. If you prefer GCP or Azure, swap the specific services (e.g., S3 -> GCS/Blob Storage, Redshift/Snowflake -> BigQuery/Synapse, Lambda -> Cloud Functions/Azure Functions).

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Hands-On ALWAYS:** Reading is fine, watching videos is fine, but *building* is mandatory. Every week.
2.  **Git Everything:** From day one. Every script, every config file. Learn branching, merging, writing good commit messages. This is non-negotiable for production work.
3.  **Document as You Go:** Write READMEs for your projects. Explain the setup, the process, the challenges. This helps you learn and prepares you for interviews.
4.  **Focus on Fundamentals:** Tools change, concepts endure. Understand *why* you're using a tool, not just *how*.

CI/CD concepts for pipelines - automating testing and deployment of DAGs/dbt projects (e.g., using GitHub Actions). Docker basics (Dockerfile, `docker build`, `docker run`).
    *   **Build (10-13 hrs):**
        *   **Secure Secrets:** Refactor your Airflow DAGs and Python scripts to pull secrets (API keys, DB passwords) from Airflow connections or environment variables, NOT hardcoded in code. If using AWS, practice storing a secret in Secrets Manager and retrieving it using `boto3`.
        *   **Refine IAM:** Review the IAM roles/policies you've implicitly used (e.g., your user's permissions). Try to create a more restrictive IAM policy for your Airflow/Lambda/EC2 instance that grants only the necessary permissions for your pipeline.
        *   **Dockerize an App:** Write a simple `Dockerfile` for one of your Python scripts (e.g., the API extractor). Build the image and run it locally using Docker.
        *   **(Optional Stretch):** Create a basic GitHub Action workflow that runs your `pytest` tests and linter (`flake8`) whenever you push changes to your repo.
    *   **Resources:**

**Final Pep Talk:**

This is a marathon, not a sprint. Some weeks will feel overwhelming. That's normal. When you get stuck (and you *will* get stuck), don't just give up. Debug systematically, search effectively (Stack Overflow, documentation, GitHub issues), and understand the *why* behind the error.

Building projects is key. Your GitHub repo will be your portfolio. Make it clean, well-documented, and showcase your progress.

Be prepared to talk about your projects in detail during interviews. Why did you choose Airflow over X? What was the hardest part of integrating Kafka? How did you test your dbt models?

You have the base skills and the roadmap. The rest is execution. Stay consistent, stay curious, and get your hands dirty. Four months from now, you can be having conversations about job offers. Now, go build something.
