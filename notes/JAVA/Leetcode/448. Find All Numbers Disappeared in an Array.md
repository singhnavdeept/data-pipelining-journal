[448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/)

Easy
<-[[Leetcode]]

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return _an array of all the integers in the range_ `[1, n]` _that do not appear in_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
**Output:** [5,6]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1]
**Output:** [2]

## 🧠 Intuition

Instead of using extra space to track seen elements (like with a HashSet), we **use the array itself to store that info** by marking elements **negative**.

- Since all numbers are from `1 to n`, we can map a value `val` to an index `val - 1`.
    
- Mark that index in the array as visited by **negating** the number at that index.
    
- At the end, the indices which have **positive numbers** are the ones we never visited ⇒ missing numbers.
    

This trick of modifying the input array to track states (like presence/absence) is super useful in space-optimized problems.

## 🛠️ Approach

### Step-by-step plan:

1. **Traverse the array**  
    For each number `val` in the array, convert it to index `val - 1`, and mark that index negative if it’s not already.
    
2. **Second traversal**  
    Go through the array again. Wherever the number is **still positive**, it means we **never visited** that index, so `index + 1` is a **missing number**.

## 🧾 Java Code
#leetcode #arrays #java #inplace

''' java


import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDisappearedNumbers(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        // Step 1: Mark all visited indices
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int index = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;  // map value to index
            if (nums[index] > 0) {
                nums[index] = -nums[index];     // mark as visited
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Find all indices that are still positive
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                result.add(i + 1);  // these were never marked → missing numbers
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}




## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time:** O(n) — Two passes over the array
    
- **Space:** O(1) — No extra space used (output list doesn't count)

## ⚔️ When to Use This Technique

- The input has values that map **directly to indices**.
    
- You are restricted from using extra space.
    
- You need to **track occurrences** or **detect missing values** efficiently.
