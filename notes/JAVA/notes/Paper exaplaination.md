Okay, Scholar! Let's dissect this sample paper like a true Java expert-in-training. We'll go through each question, analyze the code, and justify the correct answer based on the concepts we've crammed.

**Q1: Polymorphism & Overriding**

*   **Question:** Identify the correct replacement for the marked issue so that the program prints "Child" instead of "Parent".
*   **Code Analysis:**
    *   Class `Child` extends `Parent`.
    *   `Child` overrides the `show()` method from `Parent`.
    *   In `main`, a `Parent` reference `obj` is created and assigned a `new Child()` object.
    *   `obj.show()` is called.
*   **Core Concept:** This demonstrates **polymorphism**. When a method is called on a superclass reference variable that points to a subclass object, the **overridden method in the subclass** is executed at runtime (dynamic method dispatch).
*   **Evaluation:** In the current code, `obj` refers to a `Child` object. Since `Child` overrides `show()`, the call `obj.show()` will *already* execute the `show()` method defined in the `Child` class, printing "Child".
*   **Options Analysis:**
    1.  `Use @Override annotation in Child class`: Good practice for clarity and compile-time checks, but doesn't change the runtime behavior. The override works without it.
    2.  `Declare show() as final in Parent class`: This would *prevent* `Child` from overriding `show()`, causing a compilation error in `Child`.
    3.  `Make show() static in both Parent and Child classes`: Static methods are not overridden polymorphically. The call would be resolved based on the reference type (`Parent`), so `Parent.show()` would be called, printing "Parent".
    4.  `No change needed`: The code already works as desired due to polymorphism.
*   **Correct Answer:** **4) No change needed**
*   **Explanation:** Polymorphism ensures that the overridden method in the actual object's class (`Child`) is called, even when using a superclass reference (`Parent`). The code snippet correctly prints "Child" without any modifications.

**Q2: Exception Handling & Resource Management**

*   **Question:** Identify the correct replacement for the marked issue (`br.close();`) so the program correctly ensures the resource is closed when an exception occurs.
*   **Code Analysis:**
    *   A `BufferedReader` `br` is created.
    *   A `try` block attempts to read from `br`.
    *   A `catch` block handles potential `IOException` during reading.
    *   A `finally` block attempts to close `br`.
*   **Issue:** The `finally` block guarantees execution, but what if `br.close()` *itself* throws an `IOException`? This exception would be unhandled. Also, this is the older way of resource management.
*   **Core Concept:** Proper resource management in Java, especially ensuring resources like streams are closed reliably. The modern approach is the **try-with-resources** statement.
*   **Options Analysis:**
    1.  `Use try-with-resources instead of explicit close()`: This is the standard, recommended approach since Java 7. Resources declared in the `try(...)` parentheses are automatically closed at the end of the block (whether it completes normally or via an exception), and any exceptions during closing are handled appropriately (suppressed if an earlier exception occurred).
    2.  `Move br.close() inside the try block`: If an exception occurs *before* `br.close()` is reached within the `try` block, `close()` will never be called.
    3.  `Surround br.close() with a try-catch`: This would handle an exception thrown *by* `close()`, but it's verbose and less elegant/safe than try-with-resources.
    4.  `Use System.gc() before br.close()`: Garbage collection (`gc`) is unrelated to closing streams and provides no guarantees about resource cleanup timing.
*   **Correct Answer:** **1) Use try-with-resources instead of explicit close()**
*   **Explanation:** The try-with-resources statement (`try (BufferedReader br = ...)`) provides a concise and safe way to ensure that resources implementing `AutoCloseable` (like `BufferedReader`) are closed automatically, preventing resource leaks even when exceptions occur during processing or closing.

**Q3: Array Iteration & Off-by-One Error**

*   **Question:** Identify the correct replacement for the marked issue (`j < arr[i].length - 1`) so the program correctly prints "Sum: 45" (sum of all elements 1-9).
*   **Code Analysis:**
    *   The `sum` method iterates through specified rows (`indices`) of a 2D array `arr`.
    *   The inner loop iterates through columns `j` for the current row `arr[i]`.
    *   **Issue:** The condition `j < arr[i].length - 1` causes the loop to stop *before* processing the last element in each row (it iterates from index 0 up to, but not including, `length - 1`).
*   **Core Concept:** Array indexing (0-based) and loop boundary conditions. Off-by-one errors are common.
*   **Options Analysis:**
    1.  `Replace arr[i].length - 1 with arr[i].length`: This changes the condition to `j < arr[i].length`. Since indices go from 0 to `length - 1`, this condition correctly includes all elements up to the last one. This directly fixes the off-by-one error.
    2.  `Use for (int j : arr[i]) instead...`: The enhanced for loop iterates over every element in `arr[i]`. This would also correctly sum all elements and is often more readable, but option 1 is the most direct fix for the specific `- 1` issue highlighted.
    3.  `Use Arrays.stream(arr[i]).sum();`: This uses the Streams API to sum the elements of the row. It works but is a completely different implementation approach, not a fix for the loop condition itself.
    4.  `Use sum(arr, indices) instead of sum(matrix, 1, 2, 3)`: This changes the *input* to the `sum` method in `main`, not the logic *within* the `sum` method's loop.
*   **Correct Answer:** **1) Replace arr[i].length - 1 with arr[i].length**
*   **Explanation:** To include the last element of the row (which has index `length - 1`), the loop condition must allow `j` to reach that index. The condition `j < arr[i].length` achieves this, iterating `j` from 0 up to `length - 1`.

**Q4: Threading - `start()` vs `run()`, `join()`**

*   **Question:** Identify the correct replacement for the marked issue (`t.run();`) so the program *always* prints "Lambda Thread Running" before "Main Method Done".
*   **Code Analysis:**
    *   A `Runnable` `r` is created via a lambda.
    *   A `Thread` `t` is created using `r`.
    *   `t.run()` is called.
    *   "Main Method Done" is printed.
*   **Issue:** Calling `thread.run()` executes the `Runnable`'s `run` method *directly in the calling thread* (the main thread in this case). It does *not* start a new thread of execution. Therefore, the output is always sequential and guaranteed ("Lambda...", then "Main..."). However, the intent of creating a `Thread` object is usually to achieve concurrency. To guarantee the order *after* starting a separate thread, synchronization is needed.
*   **Core Concept:** Difference between `Thread.start()` (starts new thread) and `Thread.run()` (executes in current thread). Using `Thread.join()` to wait for a thread to complete.
*   **Options Analysis:**
    1.  `Replace t.run(); with t.start();`: This correctly starts a new thread, but the main thread continues concurrently. There's no guarantee which `println` executes first.
    2.  `Use t.start(); followed by t.join();`: `t.start()` begins the new thread. `t.join()` causes the *current* (main) thread to pause and wait until thread `t` finishes its execution. This guarantees that "Lambda Thread Running" is printed before the main thread proceeds to print "Main Method Done".
    3.  `Declare t as static`: Irrelevant to thread execution or ordering.
    4.  `Use synchronized on System.out.println()`: `synchronized` controls access to shared resources, it doesn't enforce the start/completion order of different threads in this way.
*   **Correct Answer:** **2) Use t.start(); followed by t.join();**
*   **Explanation:** To ensure the lambda's output appears before the main method's final output *when running in a separate thread*, you must first `start()` the thread and then `join()` it, making the main thread wait for the lambda thread's completion.

**Q5: `toString()` Override**

*   **Question:** Fill in the blanks to override `toString()` method. Output: Value: 100
*   **Code Analysis:** A `Box` class needs its `toString()` method completed. Printing the `Box` object `b` implicitly calls `b.toString()`.
*   **Core Concept:** Overriding `Object.toString()` to provide a custom string representation of an object.
*   **Filling the Blanks:**
    *   The method must return a `String`.
    *   The desired string is "Value: " concatenated with the `value` field.
    *   The `println` statement needs the object `b`.
*   **Completed Code:**
    ```java
    class Box {
        int value = 100;
        // Blank 1 & 2
        @Override // Optional but good practice
        public String toString() {
           return "Value: " + value;
        }
    }
    public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Box b = new Box();
           // Blank 3
           System.out.println(b);
       }
    }
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The overridden `toString()` method concatenates the literal string "Value: " with the instance variable `value`. Printing the object `b` automatically invokes this method.

---

**Q6: Loop and Conditional**

*   **Question:** Fill in the blanks to print even numbers from 1 to 10. Output: 2 4 6 8 10
*   **Code Analysis:** A `for` loop needs correct bounds, an `if` needs a condition to check for even numbers, and the `print` statement needs the correct variable and spacing.
*   **Core Concept:** `for` loop syntax, modulo operator (`%`) for divisibility check.
*   **Filling the Blanks:**
    *   Loop should go from 1 *up to and including* 10 (`i <= 10`).
    *   Even number check is `i % 2 == 0`.
    *   Print the number `i` followed by a space (`i + " "`). Use `System.out.print` to stay on the same line.
*   **Completed Code:**
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Blank 1
            for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                // Blank 2
                if (i % 2 == 0)
                    // Blank 3
                    System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The loop iterates 1 through 10. The `if` condition uses the modulo operator to select only even numbers, which are then printed followed by a space using `System.out.print`.

**Q7: File I/O & Try-with-Resources**

*   **Question:** Fill in the blanks to write to file. Effect: Creates file.txt with content ("File created")
*   **Code Analysis:** Needs to use `FileWriter` within a try-with-resources block to write a specific string and handle exceptions.
*   **Core Concept:** Try-with-resources for automatic resource management, `FileWriter` for writing text files.
*   **Filling the Blanks:**
    *   Declare and initialize `FileWriter` in the `try()` header.
    *   Call the `write()` method inside the `try` body.
    *   Specify the exception type in `catch`.
    *   Call `printStackTrace()` on the caught exception object.
*   **Completed Code:**
    ```java
    import java.io.FileWriter;
    import java.io.IOException; // More specific exception

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Blank 1
            try (FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("file.txt")) {
                // Blank 2
                fw.write("File created");
            // Blank 3 (IOException is more specific and appropriate)
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // Blank 4
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Explanation:** Try-with-resources ensures `fw` is closed. `fw.write()` writes the string. `catch(IOException e)` handles file-related errors, and `e.printStackTrace()` prints error details if one occurs.

---

**Q8: Console Input**

*   **Question:** Fill in the blanks to read input from console. Output: Enter name: Hello John (assuming user types John)
*   **Code Analysis:** Needs to use `Scanner` to get input from `System.in`.
*   **Core Concept:** Using `java.util.Scanner` for reading console input.
*   **Filling the Blanks:**
    *   Instantiate `Scanner` wrapping `System.in`.
    *   Print the prompt message.
    *   Use `sc.nextLine()` to read the input string.
    *   Concatenate "Hello " with the input name for printing.
*   **Completed Code:**
    ```java
    import java.util.Scanner;
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Blank 1
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
            // Blank 2
            System.out.print("Enter name: ");
            // Blank 3
            String name = sc.nextLine();
            // Blank 4
            System.out.println("Hello " + name);
            sc.close(); // Good practice
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Explanation:** Creates a `Scanner`, prompts the user, reads the entire line of input using `nextLine()`, and then prints the greeting including the entered name.

**Q9: Inheritance & Overriding (Compilation/Execution Check)**

*   **Question:** Which of the following programs will print "Complete" without any compilation errors?
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **A:** Compiles. Prints "Processing Complete". Includes "Complete".
    *   **B:** Compiles. `Beta.execute` is `final` (cannot be further overridden) but doesn't override `Alpha.execute`. `obj.execute()` calls `Alpha.execute`. Prints "Processing ". Does *not* print "Complete".
    *   **C:** Compiles. `Beta` overrides `execute`. `main` calls `Beta.execute` directly. Prints "Complete".
    *   **D:** Compiles. `Beta` *overloads* `execute` (different signature `execute(int x)`). `obj.execute()` calls the inherited `Alpha.execute`. Prints "Processing ". Does *not* print "Complete".
*   **Conclusion:** Only A and C print output containing "Complete" without compilation errors.
*   **Correct Answer:** **2) A, C** (Note: The provided answer key '5) B, C' seems incorrect based on the code analysis, as B prints "Processing ").

---

**Q10: Nested Classes (Compilation/Execution Check)**

*   **Question:** Which of the following programs will print "Task Complete" without any compilation errors?
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **A:** Static nested class. Compiles and prints "Task Completed".
    *   **B:** Member inner class. Compiles and prints "Task Completed".
    *   **C:** Private static nested class accessed via outer method. Compiles and prints "Task Completed".
    *   **D:** Non-static inner class with a `static` method (`display`). **Compilation Error**. Inner classes cannot have static members (unless compile-time constants).
*   **Conclusion:** A, B, and C compile and print "Task Completed". D fails compilation.
*   **Correct Answer:** **2) A, B, C** (Note: The provided answer key '1) A, B, D' seems incorrect as D fails to compile).

---

**Q11: Polymorphism & Overriding (Execution Check)**

*   **Question:** Which of the following programs will print Derived when executed successfully?
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **A:** Compiles. Polymorphic call `b.show()` executes `Derived.show()`. Prints "Derived".
    *   **B:** Compiles. Polymorphic call `b.display()` executes `Derived.display()`. Prints "Derived".
    *   **C:** **Compilation Error**. `Derived` cannot override the `final` method `show()` from `Base`.
    *   **D:** Compiles. Direct call `d.show()` executes `Derived.show()`. Prints "Derived".
*   **Conclusion:** A, B, and D compile and print "Derived".
*   **Correct Answer:** **1) A, B, D**

---

**Q12: File I/O & Streams API (Filtering)**

*   **Question:** Which snippets read data.txt and print only lines containing "essential"?
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **A:** Reads entire file into one string, no filtering. Incorrect.
    *   **B:** Uses `Files.lines().filter().forEach()`. Correctly filters and prints.
    *   **C:** Uses `BufferedReader` loop with `line.contains()`. Correctly filters and prints. (Less ideal I/O practice than B regarding resource closing and encoding).
    *   **D:** Appends to the file using `RandomAccessFile`. Irrelevant.
*   **Conclusion:** Both B and C implement the correct logic.
*   **Correct Answer:** **4) C, B**

---

**Q13: Code Arrangement (File Writing)**

*   **Question:** Arrange the code lines to write data to a file using try-with-resources.
*   **Correct Order:** 4 (start try-with-resources), 2 (write data), 3 (end try block), 1 (start catch), 5 (print stack trace), 6 (end catch). Sequence: 4-2-3-1-5-6.
*   **Correct Answer:** **2) 4 2 3 1 5 6**

---

**Q14: Code Arrangement (Console Reading)**

*   **Question:** Arrange the code lines to read input from the console.
*   **Correct Order:** 4 (create Scanner), 2 (print prompt), 3 (read line), 1 (print output). Sequence: 4-2-3-1.
*   **Correct Answer:** **2) 4 2 3 1**

---

**Q15: Code Arrangement (If-Else)**

*   **Question:** Arrange the code lines to print positive/negative using if-else for `num = -8`.
*   **Correct Structure:** `int num = -8; if (num >= 0) { System.out.println("Positive"); } else { System.out.println("Negative"); }`
*   **Line Mapping:** 1; 2; 5; 4; 6; 3; 7.
*   **Analysis of Option 1 (125634):** `int num = -8; if (num >= 0) { System.out.println("Positive"); else { System.out.println("Negative"); } }` - This sequence puts the `else` block *inside* the `if` block's braces and places the `if` block's closing brace (4) at the very end, which is syntactically incorrect Java. However, it follows the *logical flow* for `num = -8`: 1 (init) -> 2 (check false) -> 6 (else) -> 3 (print Negative). Given the options, this is likely the intended answer despite the flawed representation of code structure.
*   **Correct Answer:** **1) 1 2 5 6 3 4** (Assuming it represents the logical flow pieces despite incorrect brace placement in the sequence).

This detailed breakdown should help solidify your understanding, Scholar! Remember to pay close attention to polymorphism rules, resource management best practices (try-with-resources!), loop boundaries, threading concepts (`start`/`run`/`join`), and basic syntax structure.
